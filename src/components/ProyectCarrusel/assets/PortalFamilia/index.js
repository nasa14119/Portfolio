    In my school, there was a page horrible that every student needed to use. I decided to make my own version of it, with only the must-have that I thought of. I make this with react and react-router. Key features being; live changing PDF viewer in the "Reglamento" page. Slider in Home page for theme switch with other important information, and PDF viewer for the schedule.Â  "Horario" page is special because it is dynamic and base in JSON file. Did I mention that the theme is persistent? There are other features that are better to just see for yourself. In conclusion, is one of the more complex projects so far, I had the idea to present the design to the school but at the end preferred not to.
